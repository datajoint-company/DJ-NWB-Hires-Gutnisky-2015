# Hires-Gutnisky-2015
This project presents a DataJoint pipeline design for the data accompanying the paper
> Samuel Andrew Hires, Diego A Gutnisky, Jianing Yu, Daniel H O'Connor, Karel Svoboda. "Low-noise encoding of active touch by layer 4 in the somatosensory cortex." eLife.06619

The data are available from CRCNS: https://crcns.org/data-sets/ssc/ssc-5

## Design DataJoint data pipeline 
This repository will contain the Python 3+ code of the DataJoint data pipeline design for this dataset, as well as scripts for data ingestions and visualization

## Conversion to NWB 2.0
This repository will contain the Python 3+ code to convert the DataJoint pipeline into NWB 2.0 format (See https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/)
